A main-memory performance simulator implemented in C++ that models a simplified DRAM subsystem with optional hybrid DRAM+Flash memory configuration. This simulator captures key aspects of DRAM operation including row-buffer hits/misses, access queuing, and periodic refresh cycles to analyze system latency and throughput.~
